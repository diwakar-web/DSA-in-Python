Python List

In Python, lists allow us to store multiple items in a
single variable. For example, if you need to store the
ages of all the students in a class, you can do this
task using a list.
Lists are similar to arrays (dynamic arrays that allow
us to store items of different data types) in other
programming languages.

In Python, lists are:

Ordered - They maintain the order of elements.
Mutable - Items can be changed after creation.
Allow duplicates - They can contain duplicate values.




Operations in List

· len()
· Negative Indexing
· append()
· extend()
· insert()
· remove()
· pop()
· clear()
· min()
· max()
· Slicing
. count()
· sort()
· reverse()
· copy()
· index()



Python Tuple

A tuple is a collection similar to a Python list. The
primary difference is that we cannot modify a tuple
once it is created.

Ordered - They maintain the order of elements.
Immutable - They cannot be changed after creation.
Allow duplicates - They can contain duplicate values.

Operations in Tuple

· len()
· Negative Indexing
· min()
· max()
· Slicing
. count()
· index()



Strings in Python

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters. For
example, "hello" is a string containing a sequence of
characters 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', and 'o'.

We use single quotes or double quotes to represent a
string in Python.
 String is also non-mutable

Operations in Strings

· len()
· Negative Indexing
· upper()
· lower()
· capitalize()
· strip()
· split()
· replace()
· Slicing
· count()
· startswith()
· endswith()
· find()
· index()
