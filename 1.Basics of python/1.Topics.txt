What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a formal language that
provides instructions for a computer to execute. It's
how humans communicate with computers to create
software, applications, and other technology.

High Level Programming Language vs Low Level Programming Language

High level programming languages are those that are
written in a human-readable format and are
translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter.

Low level programming languages are those that are
written in a machine-readable format and are
translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter.

Compiler vs Interpreter

A compiler is a program that translates source code
into machine code at once, which can be executed by a computer.

An interpreter is a program that translates source code
into machine code Line By Line, which can be executed by a computer. 

Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language
that is easy to learn and use. It is a popular choice for
web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence,
and more.


1️⃣ Variables
A variable is a named memory location used to store data that can change during program execution.
Example (C):
int age = 20;
age → variable name
20 → value stored
Value of a variable can be changed later.

2️⃣ Keywords
Keywords are reserved words that have a special meaning in a programming language.
You cannot use them as variable names.
Examples (C):
int, float, if, else, return, while
❌ Invalid:
int int = 10;   // Error

3️⃣ Identifiers
Identifiers are the names given to variables, functions, arrays, etc.
Rules for identifiers:
✔ Can contain letters, digits, _
✔ Must start with a letter or _
❌ Cannot start with a digit
❌ Cannot be a keyword
Examples:
int total_marks;
float averageScore;

4️⃣ Comments
Comments are used to explain code.
They are ignored by the compiler.
Types of comments (C / Java):
🔹 Single-line comment
// This is a comment

🔹 Multi-line comment
/* This is
   a multi-line comment */
Helps in readability & debugging.

5️⃣ Operators
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.
Common types of operators:
🔹 Arithmetic
+  -  *  /  %

🔹 Relational
==  !=  >  <  >=  <=

🔹 Logical
&&  ||  !

🔹 Assignment
=  +=  -=  *=
Example:
sum = a + b;

6️⃣ Data Types
Data types specify the type of data a variable can store.

Numeric - int, float, complex
String (str)
Boolean (bool)
None
Data Structures - list, tuple, dictionaries, sets etc.

Input & Output in Python

📥📤 Input & Output in Python
In Python, Input means taking data from the user, and Output means displaying data to the user.

1️⃣ Input in Python
Python uses the input() function to take input from the user.
🔹 Syntax
variable = input("Message to user: ")
🔹 Example
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name)

📌 By default, input() always takes input as a string.

🔢 Taking Numeric Input
To use numbers, convert input using type casting.

Integer input
age = int(input("Enter age: "))

Float input
salary = float(input("Enter salary: "))

2️⃣ Output in Python
Python uses the print() function to display output.
🔹 Syntax
print(value)

🖨 Printing Multiple Values
x = 10
y = 20
print(x, y)

🎯 Formatted Output
Using commas
print("Sum is", x + y)

Using f-strings (Recommended)
print(f"Sum is {x + y}")

Using format()
print("Sum is {}".format(x + y))

🔁 Printing without New Line
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")

Output:
Hello World

📐 Separator in Output
print("2026", "01", "11", sep="-")

Output:
2026-01-11

3️⃣ Example Program (Input + Output)
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
sum = a + b
print(f"Sum of {a} and {b} is {sum}")




Control Statements

Control statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program based on conditions or repetitions.
Python control statements are mainly of three types 👇

1️⃣ Decision Control Statements
Used to make decisions based on conditions.

🔹 if statement
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")

🔹 if-else statement
num = 5
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")

🔹 if-elif-else statement
marks = 85
if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade B")
else:
    print("Grade C")

2️⃣ Looping Control Statements
Used to repeat a block of code.

🔹 for loop
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

🔹 while loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

3️⃣ Jump Control Statements
Used to change the normal flow of loops.

🔹 break
Stops the loop completely.
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

🔹 continue
Skips the current iteration.

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)

🔹 pass
Does nothing (placeholder).

for i in range(5):
    pass

🔁 Nested Control Statements
Control statements inside another control statement.

for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, j)

        
Functions

## 🔧 Functions in Python
A **function** is a **block of reusable code** that performs a specific task.
Functions help make programs **shorter, modular, and easier to understand**.

## 1️⃣ Why Use Functions?
✔ Avoid repetition
✔ Improve readability
✔ Easy debugging
✔ Code reusability


## 2️⃣ Types of Functions in Python

### 🔹 Built-in Functions
Already provided by Python.
Examples:
Python
print()
input()
len()
type()

### 🔹 User-Defined Functions
Functions created by the programmer.

## 3️⃣ Defining a Function
### 🔹 Syntax

def function_name(parameters):
    statement(s)
### 🔹 Example
def greet():
    print("Hello, Welcome to Python")

## 4️⃣ Calling a Function
greet()

## 5️⃣ Function with Parameters
def add(a, b):
    print(a + b)
add(5, 3)

## 6️⃣ Function with Return Value
def square(x):
    return x * x
result = square(4)
print(result)
📌 `return` sends a value back to the caller.

## 7️⃣ Types of Arguments

### 🔹 Positional Arguments
add(10, 20)

### 🔹 Keyword Arguments
add(a=10, b=20)

### 🔹 Default Arguments
def greet(name="User"):
    print("Hello", name)
greet()
greet("Diwakar")

🔹 Variable-Length Arguments

#### `*args`
def total(*numbers):
    return sum(numbers)
print(total(1, 2, 3, 4))

#### `**kwargs`

def details(**info):
    print(info)

details(name="Diwakar", age=19)

## 8️⃣ Lambda (Anonymous) Function
A function without a name, written in one line.
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))

## 9️⃣ Recursive Function
A function that calls itself.
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

## 🔁 Scope of Variables

* **Local** → Inside function
* **Global** → Outside function
