Python Sets

A set is a collection of unique data, meaning that
elements within a set cannot be duplicated.

For instance, if we need to store information about
student IDs, a set is suitable since student IDs cannot
have duplicates.

Hashing

Hashing is a technique used in data structures that
efficiently stores and retrieves data in a way that
allows for quick access.
